# 🐍 Everything in Python is an Object — Even Functions!

If you've been learning Python, you've probably heard the phrase: **"Everything in Python is an object."** But what does that actually mean?

In this section, we'll explore this powerful idea with simple examples. By the end, you’ll understand why Python treats **numbers, strings, lists, functions, and even classes** as objects—and how that makes Python so flexible and powerful.

## 🎯 What Does "Everything Is an Object" Mean?

In Python:

- **Every value has a type**.
- **Every type is a class**.
- **Every value is an instance of some class**—in other words, an object.

This includes basic data types like integers and strings, but also more complex things like functions and classes themselves.

## 🔢 1. Numbers Are Objects

Let’s take a basic number:

```python
x = 10
print(type(x))         # <class 'int'>
print(x.bit_length())  # Output: 4
```

Even a simple number like `10` is an **object** of class `int`. It has methods like `.bit_length()` which returns how many bits are needed to represent the number in binary.

## 🔤 2. Strings Are Objects

```python
s = "hello"
print(type(s))       # <class 'str'>
print(s.upper())     # Output: "HELLO"
```

Here, `s` is an object of type `str`. It has methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, and `.replace()`—which are all behaviors defined by the `str` class.

## 📦 3. Lists Are Objects

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3]
print(type(lst))      # <class 'list'>
lst.append(4)
print(lst)            # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

`lst` is an object of class `list`. The method `.append()` modifies the object in-place.

## 🧠 4. Functions Are Objects

Here’s where things get interesting.

In Python, **functions are first-class objects**. That means:

- You can assign them to variables.
- You can pass them as arguments.
- You can return them from other functions.

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}"

print(type(greet))      # <class 'function'>

say_hello = greet       # assign function to variable
print(say_hello("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice
```

Here, `greet` is an object of type `function`. Just like strings and lists, it can be manipulated and passed around.

## 🏗️ 5. Classes Are Objects Too

Yes, even classes are objects. When you define a class in Python, that class is itself an object—specifically, an instance of `type`.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

print(type(Person))  # <class 'type'>
```

This might feel strange at first, but it’s what makes **metaprogramming** and powerful features like decorators and class factories possible.

## 📚 Quick Summary

Here’s a table to recap:

| Python Construct | Type       | Is it an Object? |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| `10`             | `int`      | ✅ Yes           |
| `"hello"`        | `str`      | ✅ Yes           |
| `[1, 2, 3]`      | `list`     | ✅ Yes           |
| `greet` function | `function` | ✅ Yes           |
| `Person` class   | `type`     | ✅ Yes           |

## 💡 Real-World Analogy: The LEGO World

Imagine Python as a giant LEGO world:

- Each LEGO piece (data or function) is an object.
- Some pieces have built-in behaviors (methods).
- You can pass them around, plug them together, and build more complex creations.
- Even the **instructions to make LEGO models (classes)** are LEGO pieces themselves!

This consistent design makes Python **intuitive**, **flexible**, and a great language for both beginners and advanced developers.

# 🐍 Understanding the Difference Between `__init__` and Normal Methods in Python Classes

When you're learning object-oriented programming in Python, one of the first things you'll come across is the `__init__` method. You might wonder: *How is this different from other methods inside a class?*

In this article, we'll break down the key differences between `__init__` and regular methods with relatable examples, analogies, and a clear summary.

## 🧠 What is the `__init__` Method?

The `__init__` method is a **special method** in Python classes. It’s called a **constructor** because it’s automatically invoked when you create a new object from a class.

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
```

When you create a new `Dog` object:

```python
d = Dog("Buddy")
```

Python automatically calls the `__init__` method to initialize the object.

## ⚙️ What Are Normal Methods?

Normal methods are the functions you define inside a class to give **behavior** to the object. These methods are **not called automatically** — you must call them explicitly on the object.

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says woof!")
```

Now when you call:

```python
d = Dog("Buddy")
d.bark()
```

You’ll get:

```
Buddy says woof!
```

## 🧪 `__init__` vs Normal Methods — Key Differences

| Feature                  | `__init__` Method                        | Normal Method                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 Purpose               | Initializes object state during creation | Defines behavior or functionality        |
| 🧲 Called Automatically? | ✅ Yes, when object is created            | ❌ No, must be called manually            |
| 🛠 Used For              | Setting up initial data (attributes)     | Actions like calculating, printing, etc. |
| 🔍 Special?              | ✅ Yes (special "dunder" method)          | ❌ No, it's a standard method             |
| 👇 Usage Example         | `obj = MyClass(args)`                    | `obj.method_name()`                      |

## 🧸 Real-Life Analogy: Building a Toy Car

Think of a class like a toy car factory.

* The `__init__` method is the **assembly line** — it puts wheels, paint, and batteries in place.
* Normal methods like `drive()` or `honk()` are the **features** — they make the toy move or make sound **after it's built**.

You don’t drive the car while it’s being assembled; you do that once the car is ready.

## 📝 Complete Example

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, year):
        self.brand = brand
        self.year = year

    def drive(self):
        print(f"The {self.year} {self.brand} is now driving.")
```

### Usage:

```python
c = Car("Tesla", 2023)  # __init__ is called automatically
c.drive()               # Normal method called explicitly
```

---

## ✅ Summary

To wrap it all up:

* `__init__()` is a **constructor** used to **initialize** the object when it's created.
* Normal methods are **behaviors** you define that need to be **called manually**.
* Together, they help you build powerful and flexible Python classes.
